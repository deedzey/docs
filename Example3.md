# Adding a board

First, you need to create a new board. Boards in Trello represent projects, products, workflows or anything you need to work on. Basically it is your workspace.
  
You can add a new board straight from the dashboard.

# Adding a list

We cannot do much inside a board without creating at least one list. Each list functions as different a phase of your project. For example **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**.

# Adding a card

Cards are tasks, to-dos or action points that you collect and place in lists. 

Create a new card by clicking **Add a card**.

Now you can drag and drop the cards between lists, depending on which stage of your project they belong to.
