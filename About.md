# About
The first example is a structured documentation. The topics act as independent units of information that can be reused. They are not linked to information in previous topics and thus can be taken out of context and used as such. The writing style is targeting Simplified Technical English (STE) and the tone is formal and technical. Procedures describe all set up options as they would be written in a technical manual.  
The second example has a relaxed and friendly tone with descriptions closer to the everyday user. A similar tone can be found in FAQs of modern web products. Procedures describe only important steps. The rest is left to the users' understanding.
